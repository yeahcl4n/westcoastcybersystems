Technology is a vital tool for independence, but for users with executive function challenges or vulnerability to social engineering, the internet can be a minefield.

At West Coast Cyber Systems, we use the **"Safe Slate"** configuration method. This allows users to enjoy the benefits of connection without the high risks of phishing or accidental financial loss.

### 1. DNS Filtering (The Invisible Shield)
We recommend configuring a custom DNS (Domain Name System) at the router level or device level. This acts as a "bouncer" for the internet.
* **What it does:** It automatically blocks known phishing sites, gambling ads, and malware domains *before* they even load on the screen.
* **The Benefit:** The user doesn't need to decide if a link is safe. The network decides for them.

### 2. Password Managers as 'Digital Keys'
Remembering complex passwords is a barrier to independence. We implement biometric-locked password managers.
* **The Setup:** We configure the device to autofill passwords using FaceID or Fingerprint.
* **The Outcome:** The user never needs to type (or write down) a password again, preventing "shoulder surfing" theft.

### 3. The 'Allow-List' Approach
For users prone to impulsive spending or clicking malicious ads, we can invert the security model. Instead of blocking "Bad" things, we only allow "Good" things.
* **Assisted Access:** On iOS, we can strip the interface down to just the 5 essential apps (e.g., Maps, FaceTime, Bank, Photos).

### Need Help?
Configuring these layers requires technical knowledge of DNS and Operating System restrictions. We offer **1-on-1 implementation sessions** to set this up in your home.

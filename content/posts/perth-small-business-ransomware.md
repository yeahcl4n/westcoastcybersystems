There is a misconception in Western Australia that cyber attacks only happen to Rio Tinto or the Government. In 2025, the reality is different. Automated "botnets" are scanning Perth IP addresses every minute, looking for unpatched routers and open ports.

### The 'Low Hanging Fruit' Problem
Attackers know that large mining companies have multi-million dollar defence teams. A local accounting firm or a specialized trade business often has a standard ISP router and no logs.
* **The Threat:** Automated scripts encrypt your invoicing data and demand $5,000 USD to release it.
* **The Impact:** Can your business survive 3 weeks without access to Xero or your client database?

### The 3-2-1 Rule (Your Insurance Policy)
We don't sell fear; we sell resilience. The only 100% guarantee against ransomware is the **3-2-1 Backup Strategy**:
1.  **3 Copies of Data:** One primary, two backups.
2.  **2 Different Media:** e.g., One on a NAS (Network Drive), one on an external drive.
3.  **1 Offsite (Immutable):** This is the critical step.

### Immutable Backups
An "Immutable" backup is one that **cannot be deleted**, even by the Admin password. If a hacker gets into your system, they cannot wipe this backup. It is your "Get out of Jail Free" card.

West Coast Cyber Systems specializes in deploying low-cost, automated immutable backup chains for small WA businesses.

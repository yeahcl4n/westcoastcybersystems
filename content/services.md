## Infrastructure & Connectivity
We design and deploy secure, robust network environments for Perth homes and businesses. Our focus is on **accessible infrastructure**—systems that are secure by design but easy for end-users to control.

* **Smart Environments (IoT):** Custom configuration of voice-controlled automation, smart lighting, and security integration. We turn complex hardware into simple, accessible user experiences.
* **Network Optimization:** High-performance Wi-Fi and wired networks designed to handle high-bandwidth low-latency requirements.
* **Secure Remote Access:** Implementation of WireGuard and VPN solutions for secure connectivity from anywhere.

## Digital Capability & Training
Hardware is useless if users cannot use it confidently. We provide specialized **1-on-1 technical coaching** and documentation to ensure users are independent and secure.

* **Cyber Safety Mentoring:** Practical training on recognizing phishing, managing passwords securely, and safe browsing habits.
* **Assistive Workflow Design:** Setting up digital tools (calendars, reminders, password managers) to support executive function and daily administration.
* **Tech Independence:** tailored coaching sessions designed to move users from "supported" to "independent" management of their technology.

## Security & Compliance
We bring enterprise-grade security standards to local environments.

* **Vulnerability Assessments:** Scanning and hardening local networks against external threats.
* **Data Sovereignty:** Local backup strategies (3-2-1 rule) ensuring your data stays in your control, not just in the cloud.
* **Privacy Audits:** Reviewing and locking down digital footprints to protect vulnerable users and businesses.
